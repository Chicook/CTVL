### Payment

Payment will be paid out to affiliates whose users have accumulated qualified transactions based on the above structure. After each on-chain transaction, we'll calculate your commissions in USD and convert them to CAKE tokens at the time of distribution. We do this by determining the USD value of trades and then converting your commission into CAKE tokens based on the current CAKE token price when paying out. More details can be found on the [Program Rules & Guidelines page](program-rules-and-guidelines.md).

You can keep an eye on your earnings from the [Dashboards page](https://pancakeswap.finance/affiliates-program/dashboard) (coming soon!) You’ll also be able to redeem your commissions once a month on the same page. A guide will be posted here on the redemption process.
