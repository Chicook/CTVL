# ðŸ‘¥Community Moderation Page

### Purpose

\
This document aims to establish clear and concise guidelines on what PancakeSwap expects from the moderation of all of its social channels. This includes Telegram, Discord, Reddit, and other communities for which PancakeSwap may have or request moderation.

A social media moderator is expected to adhere to the policies and rules set by  PancakeSwap. This may include removing or editing inappropriate spam or misleading content, blocking or banning users who violate the rules, and responding to community questions and concerns clearly and professionally. A good moderator should also be objective and fair when making decisions and be able to maintain calm and composure in difficult situations. Additionally, a moderator is expected to be proactive and willing to learn and adapt to the community's needs.



### Communities&#x20;

This section includes and communicates, as of today, all the official communities that PancakeSwap currently has.

The moderation application is open to all our active communities. The suggestion can be proposed in the application form even if there is the idea to formalize or create a new one.



#### Telegram

Currently we have 13 official communities on Telegram, namely:

* English
* Spanish
* Chinese
* Russian
* Turkish
* Philippine
* Vietnamese
* Brazilian-Portuguese
* Indonesian

Note: If you think there is a community that deserves to be official, let us know.

#### Discord
