# Ethereum Expansion

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We have launched PancakeSwap v3 on Ethereum and would like to build with Ethereum Project Teams, and potentially introduce you to one of crypto’s largest, most engaged, and active DApps (with over 120k Daily Active Users)!

Ethereum is the birthplace of DeFi, and many crypto projects we have today – including us – have roots on Mainnet. We have brought DeFi to our community, and we will now bring our community to DeFi.

While this page serves as a quick FAQ for Project Teams to find out a bit more about us – please do reach out if you have more queries:

* Chef Icy, BD Lead, on Twitter ([https://twitter.com/PancakeIcy](https://twitter.com/PancakeIcy))
* BD Team on Telegram ([https://t.me/PancakeSwapBD](https://t.me/PancakeSwapBD))

### The people's choice for all things DeFi <a href="#h.hgrf93wsv7a4" id="h.hgrf93wsv7a4"></a>

Simple is sexy, and so is safety!

With more than $2.5B in TVL, we like to move quickly, and do so responsibly. Having more than two years of experience in the crypto markets, from bull to bear, we have been effectively delivering DeFi to our community. Don’t just trust us, please verify (link to audits [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/audits)).

With the introduction of PancakeSwap v3, we are introducing an improved Swap experience which would greatly increase capital efficiency for liquidity providers, while still allowing retail users to navigate our platform with ease.

For builders, we have kept the contracts similar to Uniswap v3 (and 1:1 identical for core contracts). For more technical information, please check out our [technical guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/smart-contracts/pancakeswap-exchange/v3).

Beyond just liquidity mining programs (“Syrup Pools and Farms”) and community engagement activities (AMAs, prize challenges, etc.) that you are already familiar with, we have been constantly innovating on our core products. We are now the best trading venue for many blue-chip tokens on Ethereum after introducing [market-maker linked pools](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/introducing-market-maker-integration-on-ethereum-pancakeswap-trade-and-share-10-000-usdc-in-724df104716) to our platform. Check it out [here](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1629740209427415042).

### Interested? Let’s build together <a href="#h.1jf6b5kxx1rc" id="h.1jf6b5kxx1rc"></a>

We are expanding on Ethereum in tiered phases.

1. For our first phase, we will be hosting liquidity mining programs (“Syrup Pools and Farms”) – Farms are already live and Syrup Pools will go live soon; interested projects please apply [here](https://forms.gle/aQwmYLpebskQmA3Y6).
2. For our second phase, we will be introducing token launchpad offerings (“Initial Farm Offering, or IFO”). This is scheduled to go live in mid-to-late May 2023, and we are currently collating a waitlist [here](https://forms.gle/rYL33d6QZKPzUL7e7).

For more information about our liquidity mining programs (“Syrup Pools and Farms”), please view this PDF:

### An example of the Syrup Pool/Farm process <a href="#h.pmok1ja7siuu" id="h.pmok1ja7siuu"></a>

1. Initial Outreach
   * We have a lovely chat (where we can share data, user stats, and memes) and your team decides to start the application process – let’s go!
   * Apply via this form [**here**](https://forms.gle/aQwmYLpebskQmA3Y6), it takes less than 8 minutes
2. Due Diligence
   * Using the information in the form, we would clarify some points (don’t worry, they’re not meaningless questions, but we take user safety seriously at PancakeSwap, and would also want to only introduce interesting projects to our community)
   * Team passes due diligence – congrats!
3. Marketing Prep
   * We ask for some design assets, some project info, and create a lovely banner (STG example below)
   * **Please note that prior to launch, PancakeSwap or Project Teams should not communicate the news of the collaboration.**
4. Launch
   * We launch the Syrup Pool/Farm, and through our team of community admins, we will monitor, collate, and communicate any feedback raised by the community.
   * We will also publish some socials on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1620746281588232193) and Telegram
5. Post-Launch
   * We would continue to stay in touch, and work together wherever possible!

### An example of the IFO Process <a href="#h.tpl73qb418uk" id="h.tpl73qb418uk"></a>

1. Initial Outreach
   * We have a lovely chat (where we can share data, user stats, and macro, like the rest of CT) and your team decides to start the process – let’s go!
   * Apply via this form [**here**](https://forms.gle/fScxJiE6qhWMHPsZA), it takes less than 14 minutes
2. Due Diligence
   * Using the information in the form, we would clarify some points
   * For our IFOs, compared to our Syrup Pools/Farms, there is a bit more back-and-forth: we are happy to share our knowledge of best practices with regard to tokenomics, product, Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy, etc.
   * Team passes due diligence – congrats!
3. Marketing Prep
   1. We will ask for some design assets, some project info, and create both a lovely banner (Wombat Exchange example below) and a [Medium post](http://bit.ly/3K9O3mY) (we have linked a vote proposal here, but as we will not be launching our voting mechanism in the initial Ethereum expansion, we will use Medium)
   2. We will also start collating questions for the **AMA**
   3. We will typically run a week-long [marketing campaign](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1562802361705578502) which can include activities like social engagement, meme competitions, airdrops, project-specific tasks, etc.
   4. **Please note that prior to launch, PancakeSwap or Project Teams should not communicate the news of the collaboration.**
4. [AMA](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1562648945721212929) (usually 1 day before IFO)
   * An interactive session with our community to clarify any questions and establish ✨vibes✨
5. IFO Launch
   * We will launch the IFO, and through our team of community admins, we will monitor, collate, and communicate any feedback raised by the community
   * We will also publish some marketing materials on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pancakeswap/status/1564616363871678484) and Telegram
6. Post-Launch
   * We would continue to stay in touch, and work together wherever possible! E.g. our post-IFO Wombat partnership using PancakeSwap Bridge [here](http://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1566694245213556737)

At every step of the process, the team is here to help – we understand that for founders and their teams, the IFO or TGE Launch is extremely critical, and we leave nothing to chance.
